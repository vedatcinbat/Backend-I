2. Project Setup with NestJS and TypeORM (Done)
    - Setting up a new NestJS project.
    - Installing TypeORM and database-specific drivers (MySQL).
    - Integrating TypeORM with NestJS using @nestjs/typeorm.

3. Database Configuration (Done)
    - Configuring TypeORM connection options in app.module.ts.
    - Setting up multiple environments (development, production, test) in ormconfig.json or programmatically.
    - Handling database connection errors.

4. Entities and Models (Done)
    - Creating an entity using TypeORM decorators (@Entity, @Column, etc.).
    - Mapping database tables to TypeORM entities.
    - Handling primary keys and auto-generation (@PrimaryGeneratedColumn).
    - Defining column types (@Column) and using special types (e.g., varchar, integer, date).

5. Relations and Associations (Done)
    - Defining relationships between entities:
      - One-to-One (@OneToOne)
      - One-to-Many (@OneToMany)
      - Many-to-One (@ManyToOne)
      - Many-to-Many (@ManyToMany)
    - Working with cascading operations in relations (cascade: true).
    - Eager and lazy loading of related entities.

6. CRUD Operations (Repositories)
    - Using TypeORM repositories for CRUD operations:
      - find, findOne, save, update, delete, count.
    - Performing basic queries in the repository.
    - Custom repository methods and queries.
    - Difference between Repository and EntityManager.

7. Advanced Querying
    - Using the QueryBuilder for advanced queries.
    - Filtering, sorting, and pagination.
    - Joins (inner and left joins) and handling relationships in queries.
    - Grouping and aggregation.

8. Validations and Constraints
    - Defining validations on entity columns.
    - Using decorators like @IsEmail, @Length, etc., from the class-validator package.
    - Handling uniqueness constraints with @Unique.

9. Migrations
    - Understanding migrations in TypeORM.
    - Creating migration files using typeorm CLI.
    - Running, reverting, and resetting migrations.
    - Handling complex schema changes with migrations.

10. Seeding the Database
     - Creating and running seeders to populate initial data.
     - Using third-party packages like nestjs-seeder or writing custom seed scripts.
     - Seeding relationships between entities.

11. Transaction Management
     - Managing database transactions with TypeORM.
     - Using transactions for atomic operations.
     - Nesting transactions and handling rollback scenarios.

12. Lifecycle Hooks
     - Understanding TypeORM entity lifecycle hooks.
     - Using hooks such as beforeInsert, afterUpdate, beforeRemove, etc.
     - Practical use cases of lifecycle hooks (e.g., hashing passwords before saving).

13. Soft Deletes
     - Implementing soft delete functionality in TypeORM.
     - Using @DeleteDateColumn and the softRemove method.
     - Querying soft-deleted records.

14. Working with Multiple Databases
     - Connecting to multiple databases in a NestJS project.
     - Defining multiple TypeORM connections in app.module.ts.
     - Handling entities for different databases.

15. Error Handling
     - Common errors in TypeORM and how to resolve them.
     - Handling validation and query errors gracefully.
     - Managing database connection failures in NestJS.

16. Testing TypeORM in NestJS
     - Writing unit tests for services and repositories using TypeORM.
     - Mocking database interactions for testing.
     - Using an in-memory database (SQLite) for faster testing.

17. Performance Optimization
     - Using TypeORM caching for optimizing query performance.
     - Optimizing complex queries with QueryBuilder.
     - Fine-tuning database indexes and query performance.

18. Custom Decorators and Metadata
     - Creating custom decorators for reusable functionality.
     - Using TypeORMâ€™s metadata storage for dynamic behavior.

19. Deployment and Production Configuration
     - Handling TypeORM configuration for production environments.
     - Managing database connections in cloud environments (AWS RDS, Azure, etc.).
     - Running migrations and seeding in CI/CD pipelines.
