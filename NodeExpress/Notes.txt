Node.js Fundamentals (Done)
- What is Node.js, how it works (non-blocking I/O, event-driven architecture)
- Understanding npm (Node Package Manager) and package.json
- Modules and require
- File system module (for working with files)

Express.js Basics (Done)
- Installing and setting up Express.js
- Express.js routing and middleware
- Creating your first API endpoint
- Handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

REST API Design (Done)
- Principles of RESTful architecture
- Structuring routes (e.g., resource-oriented endpoints)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Understanding status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 404, 500, etc.)
- Query parameters, route parameters, and request body

Middleware in Express (Done)
- Understanding middleware functions and how they work
- Built-in middleware (e.g., express.json(), express.urlencoded())
- Third-party middleware (e.g., cors, helmet, morgan)
- Custom middleware

Handling Requests and Responses (Done)
- Accessing request headers, query parameters, and body
- Sending response data (JSON format, status codes, etc.)
- Error handling (try-catch, custom error middleware)

Security Best Practices (Done)
- Using HTTPS and secure headers (helmet.js)
- Preventing SQL Injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities
- Protecting routes with authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and brute-force attack prevention

Error Handling (Done)
- Creating a global error handler
- Handling 404 routes
- Managing async errors with try-catch or libraries like async-handler

Testing REST APIs
- Unit testing (e.g., Mocha, Chai, Jest)
- Integration testing (e.g., Supertest)
- Writing tests for your API endpoints
- Mocking API calls and database interactions

Versioning Your API
- Best practices for API versioning
- Structuring routes for different versions (e.g., /v1/users, /v2/users)

API Documentation
- Documenting your APIs with tools like Swagger (OpenAPI Specification)
- Using tools like Postman for testing and documentation

Deployment
- Packaging and deploying Node.js applications (e.g., on Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean)
- Using process managers like PM2 for production
- Environment variables (dotenv)
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions)

Advanced Topics
- Caching (Redis, memory caching)
- WebSockets (if you need real-time communication)
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Logging (Winston, Morgan) and monitoring (ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana)
